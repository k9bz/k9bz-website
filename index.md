# Bio
First licensed as *WA2KNE* as novice around 1977. The oldest callbook that has this callsign is Winter 1978. For the code test, I had to get at least 25 letters in a row and I'm pretty sure I got the 26th wrong.  Anyway, I let it expire before I could get on the air and started again in 1986 as *KB6NWE*, became a general in 1987 as *N6OJU*, and shortly after that, barely passed the code test to become advanced. In 2011, with code requirement safely removed I upgraded to extra and took the vanity call **K9BZ**, because it reminds me of what I feel like sometimes like _The Busy Dog_. Also all the California (6) 1x2s were taken


Like lots of us, I keep falling out of the hobby, but watching some recent youtube videos got me interested again. I re-learned morse code and then found FT8 and FT8Call and since then have been addicted to digital.
